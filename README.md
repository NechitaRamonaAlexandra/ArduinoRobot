# ArduinoRobot
The robot scans the environment looking for enemies, and shoots lasers when they are found. If a full scan is performed and no enemies are found, it moves about half a meter forward and keeps scanning.
 
 Sensor used:
 - ultrasonic
 
 Motors:
 - DC
 - Servo
 
 Main functionalities:
 - object detection
 - use of DC motors (mostly forward movement)
 - use of laser diode
 
 ## A look of the robot
